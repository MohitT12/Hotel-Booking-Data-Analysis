# Problem Statement
In recent years City Hotels and Resort Hotels have seen high cancellation rate. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in genrating revenue, and for us to offer through business advice to address this problem.

The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.
